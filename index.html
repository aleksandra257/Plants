        <p>
          A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive
          structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division
          Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a
          flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism
          for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing
          (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population)
          resulting from cross pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and
          egg from the same flower) when self pollination occurs.
        </p>
        <h3>Alstroemerias</h3>
        <p>
          Alstroemerias are more often called either Peruvian Lilies or Lilies
          of the Incas and are native to South America. Peruvian Lilies come in
          a variety of warm colors like pink and orange and are symbolic of
          friendship, wealth and devotion. These flowers bloom in late
          spring/early summer when exposed to direct sunlight and watered weekly
          (water more often when you notice soil looking dry, water less when
          the soil looks soggy).
        </p>
        <h3>Calla Lilies</h3>
        <p>
          The Calla Lily is associated with faith and purity. For this reason,
          religious figures like the Virgin Mary are often depicted holding a
          bouquet of calla lilies. Calla lilies are also often associated with
          sympathy and rebirth, making them a popular flower at sympathy
          occasions. These beauties grow in full to partial sunlight and should
          be planted in spring to bloom in late summer. with continued care,
          they can grow up to two feet long! Once cut, calla lilies can last 2
          weeks in a vase.
        </p>
        <h3>Carnations</h3>
        <p>
          Carnations come in 3 different types: large flowered carnations, spray
          carnations, and dwarf flowered carnations. Large flowered carnations
          can grow to over 20 inches high with one large bloom per stem. These
          are also referred to as the florist’s carnation. Spray and dwarf
          carnations have smaller blooms but have multiple blooms per stem.
          These carnations grow to 12 inches and are more commonly found in
          gardens. When planting carnations take care to plant in a
          well-draining soil and in an area with ample sunlight. Carnations can
          have different meanings depending on their color – a pink carnation
          symbolizes motherly love, a white carnation means good luck, a yellow
          carnation means disappointment, etc. Their versatility has made them
          an extremely popular flower for all occasions.
