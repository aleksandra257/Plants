      <p>
        A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive
        structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division
        Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a
        flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism
        for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing
        (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population)
        resulting from cross pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and
        egg from the same flower) when self pollination occurs.
      </p>
      <h3>Alstroemerias</h3>
      <p>
        Alstroemerias are more often called either Peruvian Lilies or Lilies
        of the Incas and are native to South America. Peruvian Lilies come in
        a variety of warm colors like pink and orange and are symbolic of
        friendship, wealth and devotion. These flowers bloom in late
        spring/early summer when exposed to direct sunlight and watered weekly
        (water more often when you notice soil looking dry, water less when
        the soil looks soggy).
      </p>
      <h3>Calla Lilies</h3>
      <p>
        The Calla Lily is associated with faith and purity. For this reason,
        religious figures like the Virgin Mary are often depicted holding a
        bouquet of calla lilies. Calla lilies are also often associated with
        sympathy and rebirth, making them a popular flower at sympathy
        occasions. These beauties grow in full to partial sunlight and should
        be planted in spring to bloom in late summer. with continued care,
        they can grow up to two feet long! Once cut, calla lilies can last 2
        weeks in a vase.
      </p>
      <h3>Carnations</h3>
      <p>
        Carnations come in 3 different types: large flowered carnations, spray
        carnations, and dwarf flowered carnations. Large flowered carnations
        can grow to over 20 inches high with one large bloom per stem. These
        are also referred to as the florist’s carnation. Spray and dwarf
        carnations have smaller blooms but have multiple blooms per stem.
        These carnations grow to 12 inches and are more commonly found in
        gardens. When planting carnations take care to plant in a
        well-draining soil and in an area with ample sunlight. Carnations can
        have different meanings depending on their color – a pink carnation
        symbolizes motherly love, a white carnation means good luck, a yellow
        carnation means disappointment, etc. Their versatility has made them
        an extremely popular flower for all occasions.
